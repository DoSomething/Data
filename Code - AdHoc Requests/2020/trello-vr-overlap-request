## Run this in SQL Runner for Pledge

with nat_pledge as
(select northstar_id, vr_source_details from posts where vr_source_details ilike '%PledgetoVote' group by 1,2)

, state_pledge as
(select northstar_id, vr_source_details from posts where vr_source_details ilike '%PledgetoVote_%' group by 1,2)

select n.northstar_id
,(case when n.vr_source_details is not null then 1 else 0 end) as nat_flag
,s.northstar_id
,(case when s.vr_source_details is not null then 1 else 0 end) as state_flag
,(case when s.vr_source_details is not null and n.vr_source_details is not null then 1 else 0 end) as overlap
from nat_pledge n full outer join state_pledge s on n.northstar_id = s.northstar_id



## Run this in SQL Runner for Quiz

with nat_quiz as(select northstar_id from signups s2 where campaign_id = '9068')

, state_quiz as (select northstar_id from signups s2 where (campaign_id = '9095' or campaign_id = '9096') group by 1)

select n.northstar_id
,(case when n.northstar_id is not null then 1 else 0 end) as nat_flag
,s.northstar_id
,(case when s.northstar_id is not null then 1 else 0 end) as state_flag
,(case when s.northstar_id is not null and n.northstar_id is not null then 1 else 0 end) as overlap

from nat_quiz n
full outer join state_quiz s on n.northstar_id = s.northstar_id
