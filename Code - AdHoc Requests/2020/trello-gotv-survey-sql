# Trello request https://trello.com/c/92a9bU5j/1676-gotv-survey-match-northstars-to-campaigns
--- This looked at the overlap of users who completed a campaign with the survey respondents from GOTV
--- Note that the survey data was loaded separate into the survey schema to do this
--- There was no salient difference between SQL 1 and 2 so i removed the second

### SQL
