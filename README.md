# Data & Insights Team

This repo exists to centralize the code we want to preserve for traceability on key projects and ad-hoc requests from Trello or help-data.
Saving code here will help us ensure we have the necessary artifacts if projects and requests are revisited in the future.

## Committing
As a general rule, we should save any code (SQL, R, Python etc.) that ends up producing something that is shared in some way to a stakeholder.

## Code Review
Approval is always required from at least one reviewer for any code which is adding or updating a productionalized process in our data pipelines. Code requires approval if it will affect any of the following processes:

- Data ingestion
- Linkages between data tables
- Data transformations

Approval is not required on code which will not be put into production, such as analyses and ad-hoc requests. To be respectful of team membersâ€™ limited time and resources, only request a review on this kind of code if specific feedback is needed.
