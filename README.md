# Data & Insights Team

This repo exists to centralize the code we want to preserve for traceability on key projects and ad-hoc requests from Trello or help-data.
Saving code here will help us ensure we have the necessary artifacts if projects and requests are revisited in the future.

As a general rule, we should save any code (SQL, R, Python etc.) that ends up producing something that is shared in some way to a stakeholder.
