# Data & Insights Team

This repo exists to centralize the code we want to preserve for traceability on key projects and ad-hoc requests from Trello or help-data.
Saving these here will help us ensure that we have to revisit something we have the necessary artifact to revisit. 

As a general rule, we should save any code (SQL, R, Python etc.) that ends up producing something that is shared in some way to a stakeholder.
